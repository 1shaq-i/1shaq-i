# 👋 Hi, I'm Ishaq Ahmed

I'm a Junior Software Engineer with a strong academic foundation (BSc Computer Science, 2:1 Honours) from Queen Mary University of London and real-world experience across full-stack web development, automation, and accessibility tech. I enjoy building solutions that are clean, performant, and user-centric — from finance dashboards to Chrome extensions that improve inclusivity.
